The application launcher component (al-daemon) provides an API to enable state change
for the applications running in the system at a certain moment. The exported functionality
comprises specific API calls for starting and stopping applications as well as cancel, 
suspend and resume operations. Each application is managed in the sense of resource 
allocation using foreground or background execution contexts. 

The application launcher daemon should interact with the other life-cycle components 
in the system (System Resource Manager, System Health Monitor, Platform State Manager).
